                    <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) and virtual reality (VR) are two constantly evolving technological
                        fields, each with its own paths of development and innovation.
                        Over the decades, these two disciplines have intertwined and mutually influenced one another,
                        leading to remarkable advancements and the creation of new opportunities to enhance the human
                        experience and the way we interact with the digital world.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Artificial intelligence history</h2>

                    <p>Early Foundations and Dartmouth Workshop (1956): The Dartmouth Workshop in 1956 is a significant
                        landmark in the history of AI.
                        It was here that the term "Artificial Intelligence" was first coined,
                        and the event is often regarded as the birth of AI as a formal field of study.
                        The workshop was organized by John McCarthy, Marvin Minsky, Nathaniel Rochester, and Claude
                        Shannon, who were visionary scientists and mathematicians.
                        Their aim was to bring together researchers and experts from various fields to explore the
                        potential of creating intelligent machines and systems.
                        Early AI research during this period concentrated on symbolic reasoning and problem-solving.
                        Researchers aimed to create machines that could mimic human thought processes, engage in logical
                        deduction, and solve complex problems.
                        Symbolic AI involved the manipulation of symbols and rules to perform tasks, and it was the
                        prevailing paradigm at the time.</p>

                    <p>Expert Systems and Knowledge-Based AI (1970s-1980s): AI research in this period led to the
                        development of expert systems,
                        which were rule-based systems that emulated human expertise in specific domains. These systems
                        found applications in fields like medicine and finance.</p>

                    <p>Expectations for AI were high, but progress was slower than anticipated,
                        leading to what is known as an "AI winter"(1980s-1990s) when funding and interest waned due to unmet
                        expectations.</p>

                    <p>Machine Learning Resurgence (2000s Onward): Advances in machine learning, particularly deep
                        learning with neural networks, brought about significant progress.
                        These techniques enabled breakthroughs in speech recognition, computer vision, and natural
                        language processing.</p>
