                <p>My name is Allan dos Santos, I am currently studying the 4th semester of Computer Science at UNISUL
                    - PB, I live in São José, SC. Technology has always been part of my life since I was a child and that
                    inspired me to study it from an early age. I have technical certificates in the area of "Support and maintenance of micro computers
                    and Networks", "Administration" and "Logistics". I am currently taking courses abroad in the area of programming and
                    data analysis, also focusing on the front-end area, taking design courses and implementing with HTML and CSS courses.
                    I always seek better personal development and look for a path to base myself on, so I'm always willing to new things.
                    opportunities and experiences that will enrich my learning.  </p>
